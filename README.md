# Vodafone customer churn project
Classification model built to perform churn analysis on telco customers. 

## Business Understanding
 Customer attrition stands as a substantial expense for any company. Referring to customer turnover or customer defection, it represents the proportion of customers who ceased utilizing a company's product or service within a defined duration. This project endeavors to determine the probability of a customer departing from the organization, identify the primary indicators leading to churn, and explore strategies for retention that can be employed to mitigate this issue.

### Objective
The main goal is to comprehensively understand and analyze the churn rate along with its influencing factors.

### Project Overview
The main aim is to develop a strong machine learning pipeline designed to predict potential customer churn. This predictive modeling endeavor relies on a thorough examination of the dataset provided by the marketing team.

### Methodology
Our aim is to utilize data visualization methodologies, statistical analysis, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to unearth meaningful insights within the dataset. This endeavor into forecasting customer churn merges sophisticated data analysis, machine learning competencies, and strategic insights, resulting in a holistic strategy to minimize potential risks related to churn.

### Research Questions
1. Among customers who have churned, which type of contract is most prevalent? 
2. Which gender has the highest rate of churning?
3. Is there a correlation between total charges and the type of contract? (Box plot)
4. What is the percentage breakdown of customers who have left the company? (Pie chart)
